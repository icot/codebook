# Monoalphabetic cipher

## Solution

By following a classic approach and performing frequency analysis
on the cipher text it can be found that the top few most frequent
letters match the standard English frequency distribution.

Then, starting with the shorter words (one, two and three letters) 
and with the help of the ones having contractions (apostrophes) the
text starts to take shape. With every letter new candidates appear.

Looking for the solution would show the plain text as excerps from  as Daniel 5, from the King James Bible.
